## Introduction
#### The Challenge requested the student create a site using best practices learned in Module 2, as well as integrating previous learnings.  This includes HTML and CSS, ensuring use of new learnings to include grids and responsive layouts.

## Contributing
#### This is an individual (not group) project.  Students can contribute to the project by completing Module 2 lessons and using learnings to complete the assignment, optimizing code.

## Help
#### If encountering any roadblocks, the student has a variety of support options.  The live learnings were lacking this class.  Grids and formatting for responsive loyouts is very complex and reading and self-learning did not fully support this students learning needs.  The official documentation was too vague in some cases, and too complex in others presenting options that included many new unknown elements and coding that the student has not been taught yet and unable to utilize at this beginner stage of her education.
